# bitcoin-lottery
Step right up, and you just might win at the bitcoin lottery!  
  
This is a pretty stupid project I just did to have fun.  
It is a simple nodejs script, that generates random private keys, and their matching bitcoin wallet address. It then checks with the blockchain.info public api to see if the wallet generated had any transactions.  
  
**Why is this stupid ?**  
Because you won't really win. The chances of winning are pretty much 0.

**Why did I create this ?**  
Just to have fun and experiment. I just started getting into the whole cryptocurrency scene, and I'm interested in working on some projects related to the technology.  
  
**How do you run this ?**  
Just download/clone the repo to your computer.  
Run `npm install`  
Then run the script `node index.js`
